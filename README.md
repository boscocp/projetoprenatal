# Prenatal Project
This work in progress project focuses on getting hands-on with what has been learned in Django, MongoDB and Python. 
I'm collecting data about a real business problem and implementing a solution using DDD concepts.
This is the core module, the project contains 3 sub-modules: 1) backend with Django; 2) front-end with Angular; 3) Database with MongoDB.
The project is using docker, container and docker-compose concepts. Each module with its container.
